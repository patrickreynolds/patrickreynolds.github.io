					<div class="article-content">
					The compass of shame is an interesting model to use when breaking down conflicts between people. I find it very similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT Analysis</a> when analyzing a businesses position in a marketplace. In general, I am a relatively non-confrontational person. I don't like it, and commonly don't look for confrontation. There have been times in the past for whatever reason they do come about, and most commonly due to miscommunication, or due to someone spreading untrue rumors.
					<br /><br />
					This particular time that I will use for this example was regarding a work related issue. There was actually a software bug that arose after a release, and instead of remaining a work challenge, it turned into a personal issue between myself and another employee. The big came back to me, and initially I turned inward, or towards the "Attack Self" side of the spectrom. After being relatively down regarding this issue for a couple days trying to fix this persistent bug, I reached back out to the individual that sent this bug my way, and after some significant research it turned out to be their faulty implementation of my work that led to the bug. 
					<br /><br />
					I learned a great lesson from this incident. I learned that just because you think another individual is superior, or smarter, or has more experience, that doesn't mean they are <i>always</i> right. People make mistakes, and when mistakes or conflicts arise, it is most important to address them head on, while collecting as much information as possible regarding the cause of the problem before trying to fix it. More often than not, it is a communication or misinterpretation problem, instead of a true issue with whatever the case it may be regarding. Moral of the story regardless of the situation, before blaming yourself and taking on the problem head on and along, consult everyone involved to get as much information as possible. This will help find the root issue without attacking others or attacking yourself.
