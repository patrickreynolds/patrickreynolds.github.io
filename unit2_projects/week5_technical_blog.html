					Classes in short are models of real-world objects. Every noun - person, place, or thing - that we know of typically has a set of apparent attributes and actions. Classes can be used to model each of these objects by defining specific attributes and methods that correlate with that objects attributes and actions respectively.
					Classes, in my opinion, are best described through an example. 
					<br /><br />
					Say for sake of example we wanted to make a generic person class. While making this class it is important to only include attributes and methods that apply to every person. This would mean we could give a person the attributes of name, birth_date, age, ssn (Social Security number), etc. Then, with respect to most cases, one would add breath, think, talk, walk, run, etc. as actions, or methods, or each of these people. All of this is great while organizing information, but one of the real powers of classes comes with inheritance.
					<br /><br />
					Inheritance allows other newer classes to inherit from previously defined classes. Continuing with our previous example, what do a golfer and a guitarist both have in common? They're both people! A golfer could have additional attributes such as handicap, years_of_experience, tour_wins, green_jackets, etc., along with methods such as swing, drive, chip, and put. All of these attributes are necessary to a golfer, but by inheriting from person, the golfer automatically gets all of the other generic attributes such as name, birth_date, and the ability to walk. Same holds true for a musician. As a golfer has specialized attributes and skills, a musician might have band/orchestra_name, vocal_type, favorite_instrument, as well as the actions sing, strum, or beat.
					<br /><br />
					The moral of the story here is that when defining classes and utilizing inheritance, it's important to spend the critical time up front to determine the best way to abstract out as much information into generic, reusable classes. This will both allow your programs to be more extensible and simplistic to use.
