					<b>Stereotype Threat.</b> This is something that I feel has become increasingly addressed in today's society. The topic of social race is widely debated and constantly evolving. I am too young to have experienced the days of public segregation, but even though segregation of race isn't <i>as</i> apparent today, that doesn't mean stereotype threat can't be as equally damaging. As the talk by Claude M. Steele mentioned, stereotype threat is very situational depending on the context. What could cause immense stereotype threat in one context, situation, or setting could be non-existent in another.
						<br /><br />
						Personally, and to some surprisingly, I have experienced stereotype threat in a few different contexts as a caucasian male. One of the most apparent has been in sports. I would have to argue that I haven't let it impact me as much as others have, but some of the most apparent stereotype threat situations commonly came while running track back in school. In all honesty, I never had to work incredibly hard for my speed, it's just something that I was born with.I can remember multiple races from being very young in elementary school, all the way up until high school where I lined up for my 100m dash and looked to my left, and back to my right, only to realize that I was the only non african-american runner in the race. Words were rarely said about it in the starting blocks, but looks said it all. Many people would have pre-defined views on my performance specifically due to my race.
						<br /><br />
						This was a great experience to witness first hand at that age because I have forever been aware and cautious to always refrain from making remarks, or raising a situation where someone would be outcasted due to race. Because stereotype threat is incredibly situational by environment, there are many people that have experienced very little stereotype threat like situations, and others that have experienced endless accounts. The most important thing in my opinion is not to criticize those who may unintentionally contribute to the stereotype, but to educate them on how it could affect that individual. The more you can educate someone, and the more you can raise constant awareness, the more you can potentially reduce future situations.
