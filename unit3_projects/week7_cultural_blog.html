					<i>Can you think of ay other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</i>
					<br /><br />
					This is a particularly hard question for me to answer. I know it sounds like I'm being cliche and avoiding the question, but I'm the type of person that is rarely ever down about anything. I've loved my entire life incredibly thankful for the family, friends, things and opportunities I have had along the way. Many of my closest friends have never seen me in a bad mood because I simply love lift, and am always looking at the world with the glass half full. That being said, one of my biggest goals over the past few years is to get into a very innovative, well respected tech company. The finish line to this journey is now finally in sight after graduating college, and so close to being obtained. The only thing that I could see me getting down about in the near future is rejection after not being accepted during an interview process to a company I'm really excited to work for. I am aware that many of the companies on my list are extremely competitive, and the general probability of me getting in is more slim than any other past positions, but I feel this is finally an opportunity to really catapult myself out of my comfort zone, and swing for the fences. My fear will not be striking out while swinging for the fences, my fear would be settling for a single or double because I've run out of at bats. Staying positive though :)
