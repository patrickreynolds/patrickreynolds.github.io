							<div class="article-content">User experience and design could potentially mean many things to many different people. In the context of the web, we look at user experience and design as how the users of a particular view and interact with the web page. Whether it be an e-commerce website where the priority is to sell the most product, or a social media website where one of the main priorities is to encouge the sharing of content, there is always a influential, driving motive for the design of a web page. The following three pages in my opinion not only capture their intended objective, but constantly excede it in my opinion.
						</div>
						<div class="article-content">
							<br /><b>Code Academy</b> is one of these sites.<img class="article-image" src="images/codeacademy_screenshot.png" /> Code Academy offers a free platform for people wanting to learn how to program. The site starts new programmers off with either Ruby, PHP, or Javascript programming languages, and all of them are evaluated right in the browser. The user experience and interactive featuers that Code Academy has included with the learning environment is one of the best of its kind. 
						</div>
						<div class="article-content">
							<b>Square</b> is the second website that I believe does an amazing job an encapsulating what the company is all about. <img class="article-image" src="images/square_screenshot.png" /> clasSquare in an industry leader in personal payment as well as product design. Square's website and web application are incredibly clear and clean whilst offering a great user experience. 
						</div>
						<div class="article-content">
							<b>StumbleUpon</b> is the third site that I believe knocks the focus on one thing and one thing well objective. StumbleUpon set out to open up in internet in a sence by suggesting specific websites and content based on a users interests. <img class="article-image" src="images/stumbleupon_screenshot.png" />StumbleUpon offers an incredibly simple user experience considering the ammount of data and content their applicaiton in managing and filtering on the back end.
						</div>
						<div class="article-content">
							For these reasons, I think Code Academy, Square, and StumbleUpon all offer an incredibly thought out product design along with a great user experience.

						<div class="article-content">Well thought out css classes can not only speed up your development, but they can eliminate all kinds of confusion down the road. Looking at CSS in an "object oriented" sense might be a bit complicated at first, but after practicing the art of abstraction, things start to become second nature. I can't entirely speak from experience yet, but it's definitley a work in progress.<br />The image to <img class="article-image" src="images/css-class-example.png" /> the left is an example about how you might want to think about structuring css classes. This is actually an early example of the very css that syles this blog post. Each blog post is considered an article, each article has a title and info, and each article has content. For each of these classes, we can define a new class that contains attributes that are only associated with that specific element. By writing "modular" classes, we can reuse them as needed for other places in our styling. For example, the image within this paragraph as particular attributes associated with in that one would commonly want to use for an image embedded in a piece of text. This allows yourself, or other developers, to use the "article-image" class for future development. This allows a team to work faster, stay organized, and increase overall efficiency.</div>
