						First off I couldn't be more thankful to hear this talk. It really does reinforce the core reason of why DBC exists, and why it is such an exciting opportunity. There are two things that I want to reflect on specifically. The first is my refelction on the two views of DBC that Shareef describes students have of DBC, and the two fears students have as well.
						<br />
						<br />
						So the views. I couldn't agree with these two perspectives more. I personally have encountered both of them in my first few pairing sessions alone. The two views are as follows. The first view is that some look at DBC as a restaurant. They see the price of the program, and think "Ok. I'll pay $12,000 to be a software engineer and everything will be good." Bad idea. From my short experience in the industry, it takes a special person combined with a lot of experience to be a good software engineer. The other view Shareef outlines are the people that come into DBC and "own" the experience. They are constantly pushing other around them, and trying to milk it for all it's worth. I definitley think I resonate with this view directly.
						<br />
						<br />
						The second is regarding the two fears. The first fear is from new, very beginner level programmers that feel a sense of not belonging. The second, which I resonate with, would be a fear of constantly draggin along at a slower pace. I loved that Shareef addressed this during the video. In the grand scheme of things I am still very, very early in the game, and like Shareef said, the more you can contribute and selflessly give, the return is always worth the initial effor put in. It was really reassuring to hear this. I personally didn't want to feel like a "know it all" or too good for the program because I am really passionate about the program, but I do just have more hours of exposure to software in general due to a degree in computer science. I'm really looking forward to growing incrementally just as much as all the others in the program.
