						<div class="article-content">So margin, border, padding.. How are they all related? Every element on an html page has associated margin, border, and padding attributes, the trick is knowing when to set them, and how it will affect other surrounding elements. The most common method for explaining margin, padding, and border is the box model. The box model shows which part of a standard box is represented by the margin, which by the border, as well as the padding. You can see the visual diagram here. <br /><br /> In my own opinion, I would describe margin, border, and padding as the following. Say we have a box with an item inside. The space between the item and the box itself on the inside is the padding. The thickness of the cardboard, or material of the box, would be considered the border, and the exterior space outside of the box would be considered the margin. <br /> <br />For a more math minded person, one could look at the box as follows: <br /><br /><b>Box Width</b> = left margin + left border + left padding + width + right padding + right border + right margin. <br /><br /><b>Total Height</b> = top margin + top border + top padding + height + bottom padding + bottom border + bottom margin. <br /><br/><b>Visual Representation</b> <br /><img class="article-image" src="images/box_model.png" />

						<div class="article-content">Well thought out css classes can not only speed up your development, but they can eliminate all kinds of confusion down the road. Looking at CSS in an "object oriented" sense might be a bit complicated at first, but after practicing the art of abstraction, things start to become second nature. I can't entirely speak from experience yet, but it's definitley a work in progress.<br />The image to <img class="article-image" src="images/css-class-example.png" /> the left is an example about how you might want to think about structuring css classes. This is actually an early example of the very css that syles this blog post. Each blog post is considered an article, each article has a title and info, and each article has content. For each of these classes, we can define a new class that contains attributes that are only associated with that specific element. By writing "modular" classes, we can reuse them as needed for other places in our styling. For example, the image within this paragraph as particular attributes associated with in that one would commonly want to use for an image embedded in a piece of text. This allows yourself, or other developers, to use the "article-image" class for future development. This allows a team to work faster, stay organized, and increase overall efficiency.</div>
