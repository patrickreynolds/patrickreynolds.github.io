		<p>Since I have no idea what we're supposed to write about in these paragraphs, I'll tell you a little bit about one of my passions - Traveling. I've always wanted to travel abroad, and the summer after my freshman year of college I finally got the opportunity to take the plunge. It was great because I got the opportunity to backback numerous countries and study in Spain for the last half of my trip. I was even lucky enough to see Spain win the world cup while I was there. Yes, the <b>World Cup</b>. <br /><br />It was pretty awesome to say the least. I constantly get asked what were my favorite countries, and even though it's practically impossible to answer that, to make things less complicated I usually say:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Spain<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=spain&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=HN1WU8OxLIKLyAS5-oG4DQ&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&biw=1420&bih=762"><img class="flag_image" src="images/spain_flag.gif" /></a></li>
			<li>Germany<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=germany&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=bN1WU8iuF9KRyASnpYGIDg&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1420&bih=762"><img class="flag_image" src="images/germany_flag.gif" /></a></li>
			<li>Switzerland<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=germany&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=bN1WU8iuF9KRyASnpYGIDg&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1420&bih=762#q=switzerland&tbm=isch"><img class="flag_image" src="images/switzerland_flag.jpeg" /></a></li>
		</ol>
		<p>All of the countries I visited were <i>awesome</i> in their own way, but those three, in that order, were some of my favorites. Whilst traveling as a poor college student, I was trying to be as thrifty as possible. Outlined below in no particular order are a few methods I suggest to save some money. They all worked for me in their own way.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.eurail.com/" target="_blank">Eurail</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/" target="_blank">Hostels</a></li>

			<li><a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/" target="_blank">Couch Surfing</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb.com</a></li>
			<li>Make lots of friends.</li>
		</ul>
